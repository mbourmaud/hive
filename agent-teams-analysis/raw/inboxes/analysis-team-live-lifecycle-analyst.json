Examine:\\n1. Team creation: TeamCreate tool → creates team dir + task dir\\n2. Task creation and assignment: TaskCreate → TaskUpdate with owner\\n3. Agent spawning: Task tool with team_name parameter\\n4. Agent work cycle: claim task → work → mark completed → go idle → get new task\\n5. Idle notifications: automatic when agent turn ends\\n6. Shutdown flow: SendMessage shutdown_request → agent responds with shutdown_response → process terminates\\n7.
